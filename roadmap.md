Here is a list of items to be done for the whole project, in order.

Highlighting:

1. __Communication between the Eclipse plugin and the backend server__: restablish a proper communication and use of the provided services since the latest changes in the backend. See issues: [a](src/poc#alignment-with-the-latest-backend-implementation), [b](src/poc/document#alignment-with-the-latest-backend-implementation), [c](src/poc/editors#alignment-with-the-latest-backend-implementation).
1. __Highlighting workflow__: check how highlighting update is made, especially against the document update. [See item](src/poc/editors#highlighting).
1. __Document update__: check that document synchronization between the plugin and the backend works. See [this tutorial](https://github.com/ariatemplates/editor-backend/client.md#update-the-content-of-the-document) and [this item](src/poc/document#update).
